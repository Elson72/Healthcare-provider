# Healthcare Provider Dashboard

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the transformation and visualization of healthcare data using Power BI. The goal was to create an interactive and insightful dashboard showcasing data on patient metrics, billing, medication costs, and geographic analytics. The approach followed best practices for data transformation, visualization, and presentation.


## Tools
- MS Power Bi - was used for data modelling, DAX Calculations, data visualtion and interpretation
- MS Power Point - was for background layout design

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Loaded and cleaned data in power bi's power query editor mode where we examined each column of our dataset to ensure they're in the accurate data format, then systematic addition of columns for calendar data and patient metrics, Created a date table and established table relationships for better data connectivity.

## Data Analysis
- Created measures for healthcare costs such as medication, treatment, and insurance coverage.

- Calculated averages, totals, and revenue measures tailored to healthcare analytics.
### Visualization 
We developed visually appealing graphs and charts, including column and map charts, with percentages formatted appropriately in which we applied gradient background colors, dark mode/light mode, and color customizations for better visual clarity. Also labels, shapes, shadows, and dashboard elements were customized for professional-level visualization.
